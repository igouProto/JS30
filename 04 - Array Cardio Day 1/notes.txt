Learning points:

console.table() // should have known this earlier...

Basic array functions
- filter (for each item, if the function that uses the item as the input evaluates to true, it'll add to the returned array. Other items goes to the void.)
- map
- sort
- reduce (we have access to something from the last time and can use it in the next round)

Basic web scraping (kinda?)
Query selector can be ran on any DOM element, not just document
Method chaining (is that the proper term?)
String splitting
