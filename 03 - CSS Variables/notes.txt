Learning points:

- CSS variables and how to control them programatically.
- Under _proto_ of an object, we can see every method that it has
- Events (change, mousemove)
- Dataset (an object containing all data-xyz of the target)
- The root node (document.documentElement) and how to set its properties

Extra stuff I added:
- Set default value on load
- Numeric display
