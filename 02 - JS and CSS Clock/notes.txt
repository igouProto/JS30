Learning points:

- CSS (backdrop-filter, transform-origin, transition-timing-function)
- Using JS to control CSS (xyz.style)

Extra stuff I added:
- Different BG image
- Hands whose length varies
- Thinner and red second hand
- simple digital clock 
- backdrop blur effect
- an if statement that prevents the second hand from going backwards
