Debouncing: 
A programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often.
In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.
(In the example from this tut, the debounce function only runs the function
passed in it every x ms)


- setTimeout(smth, delay): Sets a timer which runs smth once the timer expires.
returns a timeoutID that identifies the timer set.

- clearTimeout(timeoutID): cancels the timeout previously set by setTimeout;

- Function.prorotype.apply(this, [args]): 
calls the Function by passing in [args] and gives it access to this.
