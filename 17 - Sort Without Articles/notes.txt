- Array.sort
sort() takes a comparison function that has a, b as the params
comp(a, b) > 0 -> [b, a]
comp(a, b) < 0 -> [b, a]
comp(a, b) === 0 -> keeps original order

- comparing strings?
strings can be compared alphabetically
i.e. apple > ball

- regex

- string.replace(pattern, replacement)
- string.trim() // removes whitespace from both ends

- query selector: #xyz selects id = "xyz"
