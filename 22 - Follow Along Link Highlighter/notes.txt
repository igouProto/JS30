- How this works:
A span that figures out where and how big the item we're pointing at
then moves itself to the right place and grow/shrink itself

- element.getBoundingClientRect()
Gives a DOMRect object including the size of an elt and its position relative to the viewport
(Viewport's origin is at the top left corner)
