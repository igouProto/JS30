Learning points:

A lot of CSS!

- position:
    - static: 
    Element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. 
    The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. 
    This is the default value.
    
    - relative: Element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
    Properties moves the element from its ORIGINAL position.
    Useful when we want to move something without affecting the layout around it

    - absolute: position is relative to its parent

- box sizing
Specifies whether to include the padding and border in an elt's total width and height

    - border-box: padding and border does NOT add to the width / height
    - content-box: padding and border adds to the width / height (default)


- initial / inherit
    - initial: set to default
    - inherit: same as parent

- flex-wrap
Whether flex items are forced on one line or can be wrapped
    - nowrap: default
    - wrap: wraps
    - wrap-reverse: wraps and reverses the direction

- flex-basis
Sets the initial main size of a flex item.

More media playback:
- play/pause/scrub/see progress
- fullscreen! 
- it's the best to get playback states from the video itself, since there are many ways to control playback.

Other notes:    

- On the web, the default origin is the TOP-LEFT corner of a given context 
(with positive y-coordinate values being below the origin).

- Data attribute: if you want your custom attribute, put it after data- like data-xyz
then you can access it with the dataset attribute.

- You can test you function out simply by calling it it the console.

- Another syntax to call methods: Object[method]();

- event.offsetX (look into this later)

Extra things I added:
- Fullscreen button!
- Number displays (vol/spd/progress)
- icons!
- tweaks on the progress bar (further grows when hovering)
