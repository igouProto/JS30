Learning Points:

CSS stuffs:
- ::before / ::after
allows you to stick stuff to smth without it being in the HTML

- +
For selecting adj. siblings.
i.e.,
<p class="first"></p>
<p class="second"></p>

Event delegation:
Listen for something at the parent, and do the filtering to
check if it's the actual thing that we want it to respond.

Local Storage (worked with it before)

Extra things I added:
- Animate the box in
- Link to clear local storage
- animate on new item
