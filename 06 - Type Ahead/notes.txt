Learning points:
- Fetching external data with the fetch API
- Promise (something that evetually comes back (and change))
- .then() // then(onFulfilled) or then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
- regex (and with variable)
- .replace()

Extra stuff I added:
- Make the result array empty if the input field is empty.
- Slide in animation for the entire list (but I disabled it cuz it makes me dizzy)
